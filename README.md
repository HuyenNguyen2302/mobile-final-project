#Overview 


WeRideshare is an android app that provides an easy-to-use, consistent system for commuters looking to carpool. Both drivers and riders will be able to save money by sharing rides. The difference between WeRideshare and other cab services like Uber is it does not require the driver to be a full-time driver. Instead, both riders and drivers will provide information about their current location and destination. If the current locations and destinations of a particular driver and rider are at most 1 mile apart, then WeRideshare matches them together. If there are several potential drivers, riders are provided with a list of drivers whose current location and destination are within 1 mile radius. Then, they can send a carpool request to any drivers on the list. After this, the driver can then accept or decline the request to share the ride. Riders will then be picked up and dropped off along the way. In this way, drivers lower their travel cost, while not having to wait for riders like full-time cab drivers. 



#Purpose and Need 

People who live in big cities have the need to carpool. The reason is traffic can get bad. Plus, it is hard and expensive to find a parking lot. For instance, according to Boston Magazine, “forty-six percent of Boston’s workforce drives to their place of business, either alone or in a carpool. There’s approximately one vehicle per household, despite a high rate of carless households (35.8 percent). And how many parking spots await them? The Globe took a stab at figuring it out in March, and came back with a big, fat, “Who knows?” That doesn’t bode well for the city’s looming parking crisis.”

Based on the chart, 41% people drove alone, while only 5% of people carpooled. If the people who drove alone can carpool, the number of vehicles on the street in the morning will decrease by a factor of 2 at the minimum.

Uber has a carpool service called Uber Pool. However, Uber Pool is only available in the following cities in the United States:
