#Overview 


WeRideshare is an android app that provides an easy-to-use, consistent system for commuters looking to carpool. Commuters will be able to save time and money by carpooling. People will upload data to WeRideshare offering or requesting rides. A user can either use the app to search for a commute based on start and end locations. Drivers can then accept or decline requests to rideshare.


#Purpose and Need 

WeRideshare solves the problem of users who do not own a car and are looking to carpool with other people to the same destination on a consistent basis. In addition, WeRideshare also helps sustain the environment by cutting down on gas emissions. Alternative ride sharing apps only do a one time trip, but if a user needs a trip to work every day, then transportation costs quickly rise and gas is wasted. WeRideshare will crowdsource both its drivers and riders by interest to save money.
